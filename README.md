## About HR-Database

This app would be used by a distribution company to add new hires to a database and track those hires in a distribution center setting. The user could search a specific employee and find information pertaining to them. This information would include salary, start date, and department. This information could be updated to reflect promotions or transfers to different departments. The user could also search entire departments to display all employees currently working in a chosen department.
